# Writeups

## Level 0
I used <b>ssh</b> command to log in to bandit0. <br> They have given username (bandit0) and password (bandit0) and port 2220.
<br>
It is required to find <b>password for bandit1</b> using it.

## Level 1
### Level 0 -> Level 1
I took help from the manual pages and walkthrough playist to clear this level. <br> While logged into the Level0 I used <b>ls</b> command to see the files. After running the <b>ls</b> command, the output showed that there is a file named <b>readme</b> . Then I used <b>cat readme</b> to read the file and it contained a string which I used as the password to log in to bandit1.
